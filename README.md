## Internal Force Calculator
**IN DEVELOPMENT**

Design structure, calculate support reactions and internal forces in elements of that structure.

Limitations:
* Only statically solvable structures
* Only not closed structures (from node there is only one way to get to another node)


*This project have been started at August 2016.*
